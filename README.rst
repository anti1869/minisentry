MiniSentry. Stripped Sentry replacement for development
=======================================================

Sentry is too resource heavy for tiny tasks. If you need just to receive your
exceptions from apps and quickly browse them, use this.

You can kep your `raven` setup. Just replace Sentry server with this.

Tested only with Python apps. Do not use on production.
